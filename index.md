## Analyzing Bad Mouths

To keep data processing times minimal, I selected around 100 posts from 78 subreddits to analyze. 

# Analyzing Proportion of Posts that Swear in Different Sub-Reddits
The following figure shows the proportion of posts in the selected subreddits that swear.

A key take away from the figure above is that subreddits that are based on some type of complaining tend to have the highest proportion of posts that swear. For example, the subreddits with the highest, second highest and fourth highest proportion of posts that swear are: "fuckepic", "misanthropy" and "rantgrumps". "fuckepic" is described as "The premiere source for all Epic Games criticism". "misanthropy" is defined as "the general hatred, distrust or disdain of the human species or human nature". "rantgrumps" is where Redditors "Rant and Vent about Game Grumps". 

Next, I looked at the median score in each subreddit of posts that swear vs. posts that don't swear. This is shown in the following plot.
